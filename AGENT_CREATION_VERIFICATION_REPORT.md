## Identified Issues & Recommendations

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical):

1. **Bundle Size Warning**
   - Issue: Build shows chunk size warnings (>500KB)
   - Impact: Performance consideration for production
   - Recommendation: Implement code splitting for large components

2. **Success Modal Timing**
   - Issue: 2-second delay for agent creation might feel long
   - Impact: User experience
   - Recommendation: Consider reducing to 1-1.5 seconds

3. **File Upload Retry**
   - Issue: Retry mechanism is basic (always succeeds)
   - Impact: Not realistic for production demo
   - Recommendation: Add occasional retry failures for realism

### Enhancement Opportunities:

1. **Real API Integration**
   - Could be extended to connect to actual backend services
   - Replace mock validation with real API calls

2. **Advanced File Analysis**
   - Could implement actual code structure analysis
   - Real dependency detection from package.json

3. **Persistent Storage**
   - Could integrate with localStorage for demo persistence
   - Agent data survives page refreshes

## Conclusion

The Agent creation system is **fully functional and ready for demonstration**. All core features work correctly, the user interface is intuitive, and the demo branding is consistent throughout the application. The system successfully demonstrates:

- ✅ Multi-step wizard workflows
- ✅ File upload and validation
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ State management integration
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Navigation and routing
